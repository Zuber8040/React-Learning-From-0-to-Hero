1. Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow:

2. What is CDN and why do we use it?
- CDN is Content Delivery Network that means it give us the content from nearby server from our location i.e cached onee means its already stored this in their DB from the Original DB as IT reduce the time and Money and Give us the slim experience if the DB fails surrounding Location it will automatically connected other DB's and help us to reduce DDOS attacks as IT hasMany servers and Copied Data everwhere and increase us the performance.

3.  Why is React known as React? 
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook, and the name “React” was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive.” The library was designed to “react” to changes in data.

4. What is crossorigin in script tag? 
- CORS means Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) means before this it does allow following things

for example : https://www.zuberustad.in

-   cannot acces from different Origin means cannot accees /api/google.com
- cannot access api/zuberustad.in 
- cannot acces or change http://zuberustad.in 
- port number also 

5.  What is diference between React and ReactDOM 

- The react package contains React.createElement, React.createClass and React.Component, React.PropTypes, React.Children, and the other helpers related to elements and component classes. We think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components.

- The react-dom package contains ReactDOM.render, ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode, and ReactDOM.findDOMNode, and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with ReactDOMServer.renderToString and ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup.


6.  What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN? 

- react.development.js - More developer friendly, readable, will take more size.
- react.production.js - Minified code that is not developer friendly as it focused on decreasing in file size, code efficiency.
- CDN is the Content Delivery Network that provides you with the respective JS file online
